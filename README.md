## Overview

Mica Visual Studio provides four materials to apply as your window backdrop:

1. Mica
2. Tabbed/Mica Alt
3. Acrylic
4. Glass

Official documentation of these materials can be found here (excluding Glass): [Materials in Windows (learn.microsoft.com)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/design/signature-experiences/materials)

## Features and options

Another feature of Mica Visual Studio is corner preferences. This allows you to customize the the corners of a window. You can choose from three options:

- Round
- Round small
- Square

Mica Visual Studio allows you to select where and what is applied to different windows. You can apply a specific backdrop and corner preference to the main window and another backdrop and corner preference to tool windows.

## Issues

Mica Visual Studio may contain two main issues, being:

- A washed out appearance (depending on your Visual Studio theme) and
- [Duplicate caption buttons](https://github.com/Tech5G5G/Mica-Visual-Studio/issues/1)

If you are facing the first issue, you may want to try applying Tabbed instead of Mica as your backdrop.  
For the second issue (as linked earlier) there is an issue open on GitHub. If you have any ideas on a fix, feel free to reply.

If at any point in your usage of Mica Visual Studio you experience a bug, please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/Tech5G5G/Mica-Visual-Studio/issues).
